## General tips

- Try to block enemies in front of the blue box. Bringing units with 2+ block is preferred.
- Try to find the right time to trigger the sheep that stand AFK. It is important to kill them when you have the damage to, not earlier and not later.
- Wisadel is the strongest unit currently in the game, but Degenbrecher is better.
